The package was developed for Rotated Combination of Two-Component
(RCTC) Ground Motions calculation. Please refer to the [PEER
report](https://peer.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/2017_09_stewart_9.10.18.pdf)
for some detail.

## Installation

1.  Make sure “Rcpp” and “pracma” are installed as they are
    dependencies. Otherwise, you can run the following command to
    install them.

``` r
install.packages(c('Rcpp', 'pracma'))
```

2.  For Mac users, you may need to download Xcode for command line tools
    or (by running the following command in Terminal):

<!-- -->

    xcode-select --install

For Windows users: you may need to download and install
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (and remember
to add path into the system environment path when installing):

3.  Install utility pacakge “devtools”:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

4.  Lastly, install “RCTC” pacakge:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github('wltcwpf/RCTC')
```
