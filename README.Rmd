The package was initially developed for Rotated Combination of Two-Component (RCTC) Ground Motions calculation. Please refer to the [PEER report](https://peer.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/2017_09_stewart_9.10.18.pdf) for some detail. Now the package has been expanded to include a few more widely used intensity measures, which are Arias Intensity and significant duration, 
(standardized) Cumulative Absolute Velocity (CAV), and (effective) Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS / EAS).

## Installation

1. Make sure "Rcpp" and "pracma" are installed as they are dependencies. Otherwise, you can run the following command to install them.

``` r
install.packages(c('Rcpp', 'pracma'))
```

2. For Mac users, you may need to download Xcode for command line tools or (by running the following command in Terminal):

```
xcode-select --install
```

For Windows users: you may need to download and install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (and remember to add path into the system environment path when installing):


3. Install utility pacakge "devtools":

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

4. Lastly, install "RCTC" pacakge:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github('wltcwpf/RCTC')
```
